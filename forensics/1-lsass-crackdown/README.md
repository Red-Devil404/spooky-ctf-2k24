### Challenge description

Anna Circoh has intercepted a highly sensitive memory dump, but The Consortium has fortified it with advanced encryption, hiding their deepest secrets within. Participants must analyze the data and navigate through layers of defenses to find a key piece of information we are thinking its a leaked password. Dr. Tom Lei has rigged the memory with decoys and traps, so tread carefullyâ€”one wrong step could lead you down a path of misdirection.

### Solution

We were given a lsa minidump file for the challenge. There is a great article regarding analyzing these files [here](https://medium.com/@offsecdeer/dumping-lsass-remotely-from-linux-efc47391e56d). We can use [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) which is the Python implementation of Mimikatz and can be used for parsing the secrets hidden in the LSASS process. By simply providing the file to `pypykatz` using the command: `pypykatz lsa minidump dump.DMP`, we saw some interesting data:

```

We found the password hashes for 3 users. But looking at the description, Consortium user seems interesting. We tried to crack the user hash using `CrackStation`. and the NTLM hash gave us the results:

And here is our flag! By simply wrapping this in NICC{}, we got our valid flag. `NICC{1987evilovekoen}`
